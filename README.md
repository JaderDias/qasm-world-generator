# qasm-world-generator

First attempt to write a world generator in QASM.

Generating worlds with wave function collapse was first attempted in classical computers, but quantum computers should be able to do it much faster.

In this version we use only 2 q-bits. We need to generate a world where the result 01 is not allowed. The ideal program would be able to generate any of the other possible combinations.

This 1-dimensional small example could be expanded to a 2D or 3D world with more possible blocks and rules, given enough qubits.
